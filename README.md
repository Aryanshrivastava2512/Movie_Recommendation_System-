##  Project Overview

This project builds a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on similarity and content features.

The system analyzes movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview to recommend similar movies using content-based filtering techniques.

This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Text vectorization
- Similarity computation
- Recommendation generation


---

##  Dataset Information

The dataset contains movie-related information such as:

- Movie Title
- Genres
- Keywords
- Cast
- Crew
- Overview
- Popularity
- Vote Average

The system recommends movies based on similarity between these features.

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  How to Run the Project

### 1️ Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

OR if requirements.txt is available:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2️ Run Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open:

```
Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb
```

Run all cells to generate recommendations.

##  Recommendation Technique Used

- Content-Based Filtering
- CountVectorizer / TF-IDF for text feature extraction
- Cosine Similarity for measuring similarity between movies

The system recommends top similar movies based on user input.

---

##  Key Features

✔ Text preprocessing  
✔ Feature combination  
✔ Vectorization using NLP  
✔ Cosine similarity calculation  
✔ Movie recommendation generation  

---

##  Future Improvements

- Add collaborative filtering
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
- Add user rating system
- Integrate real-time movie database API
